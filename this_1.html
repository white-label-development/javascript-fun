There are only 5 rules you need to understand, to master the value of "this" in any function and any object in JavaScript. Here's the kicker, though: these rules are all based on how you invoke the function!

    Raw function calls
    Method calls on objects
    Function calls with "new"
    Using .call and .apply to invoke a function
    Function binding with .bind


-->


<!--
	1. Simple Function Invocation - eg: doSomething()

-->

<script>
function doStuff(){
    console.log("I'm doing things!");
    console.log(this);
  }

  doStuff();
</script>

<!--
when run in a browser the above function call will resolve "this" to the "window" object (unless "use strict" is on).
when run in a different environment this will be different. In NodeJS there is no "window" object.  There is, however, a "global" object that works similarly to the "window" object in a browser.
